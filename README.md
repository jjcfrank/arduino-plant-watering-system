# An Arduino Plant-watering System written in C++

The system waters a plant based on soil moisture and ambient temperature. If it the soil is too dry or the ambient temperature is too high, the 3 volt water pump is activated.

To implement such project you need:

1. Arduino nano IoT or Uno
2. 3 volt relay
3. 3 volt water pump + tubing
4. Capacity soil moisture (I used Adafruit's Stemma Soil moisture which includes a temperature sensor)
5. Jumper wires

I plan to connect a Raspberry Pi Zero to store data and do further management.

Stay tuned.
